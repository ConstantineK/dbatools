Things we know:
  Remove a large amount of commands and find the "core" module scope
    - If we do this first then we get to avoid changing things we dont need.

  Replace all urls (lets leave copyrights for now)
  Replace all -Dba in commands we keep with nothing (and suggest the prefix in our module code)
  Remove messaging system and revert to basic PowerShell
  Remove any command that is vastly SQL best practices encoded in a PowerShell file.
    - If we want to keep any of these, we should consider templated SQL.

Things I would posit:
  I think publishing a website in probably too much work for me to care.
    * if you want to that's fine, so lets keep the docs in the module and encourage people to use them.
    * We need to find a good middle ground for some of the commands that are "heavy" and focus our time on problems we want to solve.
      * Setting up and tearing down connections and restoring backups have a lot of overhead at the moment.


Core:
  - Connecting to servers
  - Insanely common or useful operations that solve a problem
  - Testing things that matter to verify you can connect
  - Run queries
  - Get at your servers
  - With SMO
  - Let's support Azure
  - Let's use PowerShell Core


Test:
  - Verifying that which is basically important

Removing everything else
macbook + vagrant + ansible + mssql + sqlshell is a cool combo
